    .SYNOPSIS
        Gets the indirection stub settings on the Package Manager Console, PowerShell or the Prig setup session.

    .DESCRIPTION
        This command creates XML tags that can be used as the indirection settings for the target method on the Package Manager Console, PowerShell or the Prig setup session, and gets them.

        The indirection stub settings mean the tags that can be added to the stub setting file(`*.prig`) that is set up by the command `Add-PrigAssembly`. In particular, the tag is `add`. You can insert it to between the tag `<stubs>...</stubs>` of the file.

        Note that you have to typically generate unique name, and set to the tag(its attribute `name` and `alias`) in the type the target method is declared. However, you can get easily such name by using this command.

        The naming convention is similar to Microsoft Fakes's, but there is also a little different: 
        * The namespace that the stubs are located is the original namespace + `.Prig`.  
          For example, the stubs for the types under `System` are located at the namespace `System.Prig`.

        * The prefix of the stub is `P`(no conditions) or `PProxy`(specified instance of a class).  
          For example, the stub for `System.DateTime` is `System.Prig.PDateTime`. However, the stub `PProxyDateTime` isn't generated, because it is a structure.
          The stub for `System.Net.HttpWebRequest` is `System.Net.Prig.PHttpWebRequest`. Also, `System.Net.Prig.PProxyHttpWebRequest` is generated, because it is a class.

        See also [Code generation, compilation, and naming conventions in Microsoft Fakes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh708916.aspx).

        The results are output as plain text, so I recommend that you use in combination with `clip` command.

    .PARAMETER  InputObject
        A array of `System.Reflection.MethodBase` object which is target to get the indirection settings.

        PS C:\>pfind datetime _now | pget | clip
        
        DESCRIPTION
        -----------
        This is the example that is used in combination with `Find-IndirectionTarget`. Search the members that are matched to the regular expression `_now` from the type `System.DateTime`, and get the indirection stub settings. When confirmed that, it has no problem. So, copy it to clipboard, and paste it to the stub settings file.

    .INPUTS
        System.Reflection.MethodBase, System.Reflection.MethodBase[]

    .OUTPUTS
        System.String

    .NOTES
        You have to import the module `Urasandesu.Prig` explicitly if you use this command on PowerShell directly. The module `Urasandesu.Prig` is placed the directory `tools` of the package directory by NuGet when you installed Prig. So, execute `Import-Module` from there. By the way, this step requires a little labor. Using the Prig setup session would be more easier. See also the help for `Start-PrigSetup` for more details.
        
        You can also refer to the Get-IndirectionStubSetting command by its built-in alias, "PGet".
