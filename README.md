Prig
=============

SYNOPSIS
-------
Prig is a lightweight framework for test indirections in .NET Framework.

DESCRIPTION
-------
Prig(PRototyping jIG) is a framework that generates a Test Double such like Microsoft Fakes/Typemock Isolator/Telerik JustMock based on Unmanaged Profiler APIs.
This framework enables that any methods that are normally impossible to do it are replaced with mocks. For example, a static property, a private method, a non-virtual member and so on.

STATUS
-------
As of Feb 2, 2014, Prig does not work completely. However, we steadily continue to develop at the private repository. This framework will come out within the year if everything goes well.
